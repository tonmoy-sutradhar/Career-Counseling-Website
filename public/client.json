    "description": "James started to dread going to his job as a lawyer and longed for a change. Careers in Depth helped him to identify why he became a lawyer in the first place and how he could turn his perceived weaknesses into strengths to find his purpose in a new more fulfilling career.",
    "details": "James*, aged 45, was a successful human rights lawyer with substantial earnings and a good reputation but he had recently come to feel that something was missing. His enthusiasm for legal work had diminished and he had lost his sense of purpose. He dreaded the ‘Monday morning’ feeling. He wasn’t sure how long he could continue. At the same time he couldn’t see how he could leave something so prestigious and secure and still support himself and his family. He applied to Careers in Depth because he knew he needed a career change but felt stuck with what he was currently doing. In the EXPLORE stage of the consultation process the consultant focused on what had motivated his original choice of career. It transpired that James had been academically successful at school but as a sensitive introverted child he had found it hard to make friends. He had been bullied by other children who resented the praise he received from the teachers who had held him up as an example for others to follow. His choice of law had been motivated by his sense of injustice and his desire to fight for others to obtain their rights in unfair situations (CONNECT). Once the connection with his underlying motivation of helping others had become clear, his consultant helped him to explore what he felt was missing in his legal work. James felt that he wanted something that would engage him more fully with other people than winning their court battles (RESOLVE). After a homework project of researching different helping professions James decided to train as an executive coach specialising in the legal profession (ACT). In this role his sensitivity, which he had previously felt was a weakness, would be a core strength (RESOLVE). He also felt that his reputation and his networks in the legal field would enable lawyers to trust him as a professional coach who would understand the particular difficulties of their work. Due to our strict confidentiality policy we prefer not to disclose details of actual clients' cases and have compiled these scenarios merely as an illustration of the kind of work we do."
